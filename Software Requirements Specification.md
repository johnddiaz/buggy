# Software Requirements Specification

### 1. Introduction
##### 1.1 Purpose
This file outlines the plan for version 1 (MVP) of `gumshoe`. `gumshoe` will be a full-stack application for creating and managing tickets (similar to Jira, Asana, etc. but on a much smaller scale). Development on `gumshoe` may continue on past version 1, but at that point this SRS will not longer be applicable.

`gumshoe` is meant to be a fun side-project for gaining experiencing in building such a project. It isn't meant to be used as a serious replacement for other issue tracking options out there.
##### 1.2 Intended Audience
John will be the primary user for this application, as well as a future hiring manager or recruiter that may see this.
##### 1.3 Intended Use
`gumshoe` will be added to John's portfolio. It will also be used to track the development progress of `gumshoe` itself, once it reaches such level of usability prior to the release of version 1.
##### 1.4 Scope
Version 1 of gumshoe will have authentication and authorization. This means users can create an account and sign in. 

There will be different user roles available, such as admin, standard, and guest (least privileged).

Users should be able to create tickets and manage such tickets (managing involves viewing, modifying, and deleting tickets at a minimum). 

The data of tickets and users should be kept in persistent storage.

The website should be mobile friendly.

The website should be accessible from a public URL.
