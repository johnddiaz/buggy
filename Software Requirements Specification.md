# Software Requirements Specification

### 1. Introduction
##### 1.1 Purpose
This file outlines the plan for version 1 (MVP) of `buggy`. `buggy` will be a full-stack application for creating and managing issues and tickets (similar to Jira but on a much smaller scale). Development on `buggy` may continue on past version 1, but at that point this SRS will not longer be applicable.
##### 1.2 Intended Audience
In theory, `buggy` will be for software development teams (software developers, product managers, quality assurance testers, designers, etc.)
##### 1.3 Intended Use
I plan on using `buggy` to track the development progress of `buggy` itself.
##### 1.4 Scope
Version 1 of buggy will allow a person to create an account and sign in. They should be able to create tickets and manage such tickets. This involves viewing, modifying, and deleting tickets. A user may have more/less abilities depending on their role. 

The state of the application will be stored in a database.
